# Privacy Policy

Valid for the application "GG Schüler-App" for Android and iOS.

## I. General
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and treat it confidentially in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to our mobile iPhone and Android apps (referred to as "app" or "application"). It explains the type, purpose, and scope of data collection in the context of using the app. We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.

The person responsible for data protection is Lukas Engel. E-mail: app-support@lukasengel.net

## 2. Collection and Storage of Personal Data
### For Regular Users (Students):
All user-specific data (access data and settings) are stored locally on the device and are not transmitted to us. During the use of the App, no personal data is collected or transmitted unless the user uses the feedback function.

### Für Benutzer mit Adminrechten (Schulleiter):
Users with administrative rights can post content such as articles (which may also include graphics) and teacher abbreviations in the app. This content is stored on Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Storage. Firebase Cloud Firestore offers a secure and scalable database solution operated by Google. The data is stored in data centers in Europe and the United States and is compliant to the strict data protection regulations of the European Union (GDPR). Additionally, the data is protected by modern encryption technologies to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

The developer of the App is not responsible for the data protection of the posted content. The responsibility for the data protection of the posted content lies with the school and is handled according to their privacy policies.

### Feedback Feature:
In the application settings, there is a feature for reporting software bugs and sharing feedback. The name and email address of the author can be provided voluntarily if they wish to receive a personal response to their message. The data is used exclusively for improving the app. It is transmitted in encrypted form, and is not shared with third parties.

### Google Firebase
We use the Google Firebase service (Cloud Firestore and Firebase Storage) to store the content. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
